# Final Re-Review After Fixes

You are a senior backend architect and reviewer.

We already performed fixes after the previous final review.

Now do a targeted re-review only.

## Files to use as source of truth

- `architecture.txt`
- `list-function.txt`
- `docs.md`
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/data.sql`
- current Java source code

## Important rules

- DO NOT write code
- DO NOT auto-fix
- DO NOT run Python
- DO NOT do another broad phase analysis
- ONLY verify whether previously reported gaps are now fixed or still missing
- Be strict and practical
- If something is partially fixed, mark it as PARTIAL, not DONE

## Re-check these items only

### Previously critical / high issues
1. Order approve/reject workflow
2. Customer near-expiry dashboard scoping
3. Persistent invoice / billing record
4. Relocation service/controller
5. SystemLogController through service layer
6. Configurable/public fee endpoint

### Previously medium items
7. Customer activity log endpoint
8. Public pricing / fee schedule endpoint
9. Chat room type listing endpoint
10. Order edit/amendment workflow
11. Revenue/billing report
12. Manual position override / swap endpoint

## Required output

Return structured markdown with these sections:

1. Re-check Summary
2. Fixed Items
3. Still Missing Items
4. Partial Items
5. Final Completion Estimate (%)
6. Can this project now be called DONE?
7. Exact remaining tasks before final completion

For each item, include:
- expected behavior
- current implementation found in code
- status: DONE / PARTIAL / MISSING
- short reason
